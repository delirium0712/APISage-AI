## üìã **Demo Execution Plan**

### **Opening (2 min)**
> *"Today I'll demonstrate an enterprise-grade RAG system that showcases top-tier ML engineering. This isn't just another ChatGPT wrapper - it's production-ready infrastructure with multi-agent orchestration, hybrid search, and auto-code generation."*

### **System Architecture (5 min)**
```bash
# Show professional codebase structure
ls -la

# Demonstrate multiple operational modes
python main.py --help

# Show running system health
./demo/demo_health.sh
```

### **Core Capabilities (10 min)**
```bash
# Intelligent API Analysis
./demo/demo_analysis.sh

# Auto Code Generation  
./demo/demo_codegen.sh

# System Monitoring
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq
```

### **Technical Deep Dive (10 min)**
- Multi-agent orchestration with specialized roles
- Hybrid search with vector + lexical retrieval  
- Production monitoring with auto-recovery
- Enterprise integration (multi-LLM, multi-vector store)

### **Closing (3 min)**
> *"This demonstrates the full spectrum of modern ML engineering: from research concepts to production systems with monitoring, evaluation, and real business value. This is what distinguishes top 1% ML engineers."*
