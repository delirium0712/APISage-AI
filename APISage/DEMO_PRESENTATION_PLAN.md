# Show clean imports and type hints
head -30 core/orchestrator.py

# Demonstrate comprehensive error handling
grep -n "try:" core/orchestrator.py | head -5
```

#### **B. Testing & Evaluation**
```bash
# Show archived test files
ls archive_files/

# Demonstrate evaluation framework
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/evaluate" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "test_cases": [
    {"query": "API authentication", "expected_answer": "Use API keys or OAuth"}
  ]
}'
```
