## ðŸ“‹ Topic-by-Topic Quick Answers

### 1. GenAI Project Discussion (10 min)
**Key Points:**
- **Project**: APISage - Multi-agent API analysis platform
- **Architecture**: 6 specialized agents (Security, Performance, Documentation, etc.)
- **Innovation**: Custom orchestration with consensus-building
- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Gradio, OpenAI, AsyncIO
- **Impact**: Production-ready with Docker, CI/CD, security policies

**Code Example:**
```python
# Multi-agent orchestration
async def analyze_api(api_spec):
    agents = [SecurityAnalyst(), PerformanceEngineer(), ...]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[agent.analyze(api_spec) for agent in agents])
    return build_consensus(results)
```

### 2. RAG Deep Dive (15 min)
**Key Concepts:**
- **Pre-retrieval**: Semantic chunking by API endpoints
- **Retrieval**: Multi-query approach with agent-specific queries
- **Post-retrieval**: Agent-based reranking with consensus
- **Evaluation**: LLM-as-Judge with hallucination detection

**Code Example:**
```python
# Multi-query RAG
queries = [f"Security issues in {query}", f"Performance problems with {query}"]
results = await asyncio.gather(*[semantic_search(q, docs) for q in queries])
return agent_reranking(deduplicate(results))
```

### 3. Prompt Engineering (10 min)
**Key Techniques:**
- **Structured Prompts**: JSON output format with clear instructions
- **Chain of Thought**: Step-by-step analysis reasoning
- **ReAct Pattern**: Thought â†’ Action â†’ Observation loop
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Examples for API analysis patterns

**Code Example:**
```python
COT_PROMPT = """
Analyze this API step by step:
1. Identify structure and endpoints
2. Check security vulnerabilities  
3. Evaluate performance concerns
4. Assess documentation quality
5. Synthesize findings
"""
```

### 4. Agentic Systems (15 min)
**Key Components:**
- **Agent Roles**: 6 specialized agents with distinct expertise
- **State Management**: Persistent agent memory with confidence tracking
- **Orchestration**: Async coordination with consensus building
- **Reflection**: Self-correction based on peer feedback

**Code Example:**
```python
class AgentOrchestrator:
    async def coordinate_analysis(self, api_spec):
        # Parallel agent execution
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[agent.analyze(api_spec) for agent in self.agents])
        # Consensus building
        return self.build_consensus(results)
```

### 5. Coding Aptitude (5 min)
**Project Structure:**
```
APISage/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # FastAPI backend
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/         # Core business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation/            # Quality assurance
â”œâ”€â”€ config/               # Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ gradio_app.py         # Frontend
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml        # Dependencies
```

**Key Practices:**
- **Async Architecture**: All I/O operations async
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical components
- **Production**: Docker, CI/CD, monitoring

## ðŸŽ¯ Specific Examples from APISage

### **Multi-Agent Architecture:**
```python
# 6 specialized agents working together
agents = {
    'security': SecurityAnalyst(),
    'performance': PerformanceEngineer(),
    'documentation': DocumentationReviewer(),
    'standards': StandardsAuditor(),
    'ux': UXResearcher(),
    'integration': IntegrationSpecialist()
}
```

### **Consensus Building:**
```python
# Agents vote on findings with confidence weighting
consensus = weighted_majority_vote([
    {'finding': finding, 'weight': agent.confidence, 'agent': agent.role}
    for agent in agents
])
```

### **Quality Evaluation:**
```python
# LLM-as-Judge evaluation
evaluation = await llm_evaluator.evaluate_analysis(
    analysis=agent_analysis,
    original_api=api_spec,
    metrics=['accuracy', 'specificity', 'completeness']
)
```

## âš¡ Quick Technical Answers

### **Q: "How do you prevent hallucination?"**
**A:** "I implemented LLM-as-Judge evaluation where a separate model validates each analysis against the original API spec, plus multi-agent consensus where agents cross-validate each other's findings."

### **Q: "How do you handle agent coordination?"**
**A:** "I built an async orchestration engine that runs agents in parallel, then uses weighted voting based on agent confidence to build consensus on findings."

### **Q: "How do you optimize token usage?"**
**A:** "I implemented smart batching, model selection based on task complexity, and token optimization that reduced costs by 40% while maintaining quality."

### **Q: "How do you ensure production readiness?"**
**A:** "Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive error handling, structured logging, security policies, and monitoring for performance and token usage."
